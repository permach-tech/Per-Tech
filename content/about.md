Hey there, name's Persell! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a solutions architect by trade, an automation junkie by passion, and a full-time homelab tinkerer.

I started this site to share the projects, fixes, and experiments Iâ€™ve been working on over the years. Itâ€™s part documentation, part storytelling, and hopefully a place where you can pick up something useful.

Whether youâ€™re into identity and access management, automation workflows, or just love geeking out over homelab setups, youâ€™ll find a bit of that here. And who knows, maybe some of my trial-and-error saves you a few hours of head-scratching!

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring the site!
