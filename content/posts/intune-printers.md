## Introduction: Why Printer Management in Intune Matters

Managing printers in a modern workplace can be challenging, especially with hybrid work models and cloud-first strategies. Microsoft Intune provides powerful capabilities to deploy and manage printers across your device fleet without traditional print servers.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into printer configuration, ensure you have:

- [x] Microsoft Intune license (included in Microsoft 365 E3/E5 or standalone)
- [x] Windows 10/11 devices enrolled in Intune
- [x] Admin permissions in Microsoft Endpoint Manager
- [x] Network printer details (IP addresses, driver information)
- [x] Understanding of your printer infrastructure

## Method 1: Universal Print (Cloud-First Approach)

### What is Universal Print?
Universal Print is Microsoft's cloud-based print solution that eliminates the need for on-premises print servers.

### Setting Up Universal Print
1. **Enable Universal Print in your tenant**
   - Navigate to Microsoft 365 admin center
   - Enable Universal Print service
   - Assign licenses to users

2. **Register printers with Universal Print**
   - Install Universal Print connector
   - Register physical printers
   - Configure printer settings

3. **Deploy via Intune**
   - Create printer deployment policy
   - Target user or device groups
   - Monitor deployment status

### Benefits of Universal Print
- No print servers required
- Cloud-based management
- Enhanced security features
- Easy scalability

## Method 2: PowerShell Scripts for Printer Deployment

### Creating PowerShell Scripts
```powershell
# Example script structure (you'll expand this)
# Add-Printer cmdlet examples
# Error handling best practices
```

### Deploying Scripts via Intune
1. **Prepare your PowerShell script**
   - Write printer installation logic
   - Include error handling
   - Test thoroughly

2. **Upload to Intune**
   - Navigate to Device Management > Scripts
   - Upload your PowerShell script
   - Configure execution settings

3. **Assign to groups**
   - Target specific device groups
   - Set execution context (User vs System)
   - Monitor deployment

### PowerShell Script Best Practices
- Always include error handling
- Log installation attempts
- Test on pilot devices first
- Use appropriate execution policies

## Method 3: Win32 Apps for Printer Drivers

### When to Use Win32 Apps
- Complex driver installations
- Vendor-specific software requirements
- Custom printer configurations

### Creating Win32 App Packages
1. **Prepare printer drivers**
   - Download from manufacturer
   - Create installation package
   - Test installation silently

2. **Package with Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool**
   - Convert to .intunewin format
   - Configure detection rules
   - Set installation commands

3. **Deploy via Intune**
   - Upload Win32 app
   - Configure requirements and detection
   - Assign to target groups

## Method 4: Configuration Profiles (For Modern Apps)

### Using Device Configuration Profiles
- When applicable for specific scenarios
- Limitations and considerations
- Best practices for deployment

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Driver Conflicts
- How to identify conflicting drivers
- Removal strategies
- Prevention techniques

### Network Connectivity Issues
- Firewall requirements
- Port configurations
- Testing connectivity

### User Permission Problems
- Understanding print permissions
- Configuring appropriate access
- Troubleshooting access denied errors

### Deployment Failures
- Reading Intune deployment logs
- Common error codes and solutions
- Rollback strategies

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Built-in Intune Reports
- Device compliance reports
- App installation status
- Script execution results

### Custom Monitoring Solutions
- PowerShell logging strategies
- Integration with Log Analytics
- Alerting on failures

### User Communication
- Notifying users of new printers
- Self-service options
- Help desk procedures

## Security Considerations

### Printer Security Best Practices
- Securing print queues
- Authentication requirements
- Data encryption in transit

### Compliance Requirements
- Meeting regulatory requirements
- Audit trail maintenance
- Access logging

## Advanced Scenarios

### Multi-Location Deployments
- Location-based printer assignment
- Dynamic group membership
- Site-specific configurations

### Conditional Access Integration
- Device compliance requirements
- Location-based access
- Security policy enforcement

### Hybrid Environments
- Integrating with on-premises print servers
- Migration strategies
- Maintaining existing infrastructure

## Best Practices and Recommendations

### Planning Your Deployment
- Inventory existing printers
- Assess user requirements
- Plan phased rollouts

### Testing Strategies
- Pilot group selection
- Validation procedures
- Rollback planning

### Change Management
- User training requirements
- Communication strategies
- Support procedures

## Conclusion

Printer management in Intune offers multiple approaches to meet different organizational needs. Whether you choose Universal Print for a cloud-first approach or traditional methods for legacy environments, proper planning and execution are key to success.

### Next Steps
- Assess your current printer infrastructure
- Choose the appropriate deployment method
- Start with a pilot group
- Gradually expand to full deployment
