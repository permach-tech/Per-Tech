## Introduction
Planning and implementing a strong identity provisioning strategy is essential for any organization aiming to manage user access securely and efficiently. As a company expands, the need for a structured, scalable approach to handling user identities, roles, and permissions becomes critical. A well-designed provisioning framework not only improves accuracy and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, but also significantly reduces the administrative burden that comes with manual user management.

## Assess Current State
Map out your current identity management processes. Identify existing systems, tools, and workflows used for user provisioning. Understand the pain points, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement.

## Source of Truth
Determine the authoritative source of truth for user identities. This could be an HR system, a directory service, or another centralized database. Ensure that this source is reliable and up-to-date, as it will serve as the foundation for your provisioning journey.

## Scope and Requirements
Define the scope of your provisioning journey. Identify the types of users (employees, contractors, partners) and the systems they need access to. Gather requirements from stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
